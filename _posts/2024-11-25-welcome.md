## Welcome!

I'm excited to launch my new personal website at **gus.today**! This site serves as a home for my professional timeline, technical blog, and eventually a Picture of the Day section.

### What You'll Find Here

**Career Timeline**: An interactive journey through my professional experiences, highlighting the projects I've worked on, the technologies I've mastered, and the impact I've made.

**Blog**: Technical articles, tutorials, best practices, and personal insights about software engineering and technology.

**Picture of the Day**: Coming soon - a curated collection of daily photography (stay tuned!).

### Built With

This site is built using:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Static site generator
- [Chulapa](https://dieghernan.github.io/chulapa/) - Beautiful Jekyll theme
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Hosting
- **Sunset skin** - For that elegant dark theme with red accents

### What's Next

I'll be populating the timeline with my career highlights and publishing technical articles regularly. Follow along for:

- Software engineering insights
- Best practices and patterns
- Technology deep dives
- Personal projects and experiments

Stay tuned for more content!
